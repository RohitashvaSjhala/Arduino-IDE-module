# Arduino-IDE-module
This repository contains two .ino coding files which were used to construct a Bus tracking cum security module for school transportation systems.
These files use Arduino IDE to execute their intructions. To see the changes in hardware, Arduino coupled with GSM and GPS module must be connected to the usb port of the computer.
An active GSM sim must me inserted within the GSM module to send the push notifiactions and alert messages to the dezired contact number. In this code, the GSM module sends the latitude and logitude of the current location of GPS module.
